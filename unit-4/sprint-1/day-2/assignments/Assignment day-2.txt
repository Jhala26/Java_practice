Q1) Explain Type casting and its types with examples?

Type casting is a way of converting data from one data type to another data type. This process of data conversion is also known as type conversion or type coercion.
In Java their are two type of typecasting

1) Implicit casting = This type of conversion is also known as widening casting. It happens automatically when converting from a Small range data type to a Large range data type.

Ex =>

package demo;

public class basictry {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		byte a = 20;
		int b = a;
		double c = b;
		
		System.out.println(a);
		System.out.println(b);
		System.out.println(c);
		
	}
}


2) Explicit type casting = This type of casting involves assigning a data type of high range to a lower range. This process of conversion is also referred to as narrowing type casting.This is done manually as you need to do the casting using the “()” operator. 
If we fail to do the casting, a compile-time error will be returned by the compiler.

Ex =>

package demo;

public class basictry {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		double a = 20.05;
		float b = (float)a;
		int c = (int)b;
		
		System.out.println(a);
		System.out.println(b);
		System.out.println(c);
		
	}
}


Q2) Create a class Main with a main method.

package demo;

public class basictry {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		String city = "Bangalore";
		
		switch(city) {
		
		case "Mumbai" : {
			System.out.println("Financial city");
			break;
		}
		case "Kolkata" :{
			System.out.println("City of Joy");
			break;
		}
		case "Delhi" :{
			System.out.println("Capital of the country");
			break;
		}
		case "Bangalore":{
			System.out.println("Cyber City");
			break;
		}
		default:{
			System.out.println("May be Other Indian City");
		}
		}
		 
		 

	}
}



Q3) Explain the difference between local and instance variables?

 1) Instance Variable: These variables are declared within a class but outside a method, constructor, or block and always get a default value.
    These variables are usually created when we create an object and are destroyed when the object is destroyed.These variables are given a 
    default value if it is not assigned by code. It is not compulsory to initialize instance variables before use.  

 2) Local Variable: These variables are declared within a method but do not get any default value. They are usually created when we enter a method or constructor and are destroyed after exiting the block or when the call returns from the method.
    Its scope is generally limited to a method and its scope starts from the line they are declared. Their scope usually remains there until the closing curly brace of the method comes.
    The initialization of the local variable is mandatory.
